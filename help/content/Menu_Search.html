    <h3>GoldFind -- Menu - File &quot;Search&quot;</h3>
<pre>    
<span class="ds6">Here, in the following Input-Box, you can fill in, what you want to find in any form you will have.

Time    - You fill in the time-area, GF searched.


Options - You can select in Order:

   Search Body   - To search in Bodys too/or only
   Search Header - To search in Header too/or only
   Case sensitiv - Writeform will exactly considerated

Search  - Fill in, whatever you search

In 'Search'-Field, there are many ways, to fill in a term - For one example, you can fill in a term as you want to write. If you search for </span><span class="ds7">My Birthday</span><span class="ds6">, it will find the word </span><span class="ds7">My</span><span class="ds6"> also the word </span><span class="ds7">Birthday</span><span class="ds6">.

A second method is, to write your term in &quot;&quot; (e.g. &quot;My Birthday&quot;).
This will exactly find the word-order you fill in.

A third method is to use RegExp - For using 'RegExp', search for a Site in Internet - One Site, as example in german is http://regexp-evaluator.de/
in english http://www.regular-expressions.info/


To use RegExp it is recommended, you read some special Sites.

All search-patterns you add in this way are searched as &quot;OR&quot;-criterions. Afterwards all found articles are again be searched for patterns beginning with a &quot;</span><span class="ds7">+</span><span class="ds6">&quot; (plus), these are &quot;AND&quot;-criterions. As the last step, the now concerned articles are searched for the patterns beginning with &quot;</span><span class="ds7">-</span><span class="ds6">&quot;. Only those articles NOT containing any of these &quot;NOT&quot;-criterions, are found.


A click on &lt;Begin&gt; will start your search.</span></pre>
