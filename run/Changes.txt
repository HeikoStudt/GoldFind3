GoldFind 3.1.9 (xx.xx.xxxx)
  - Bug: The yellow marked searched words are not 100% OK (RegExp?).
  - Bug: Menu "Open MBox" gives hamster.ini

  - ToDo: Progressbar for "find"...
          Progressbars: Cancel-Button is not everywhere functional
  - ToDo: Able to disable date-window...
          Save and use <n> days (???).
          Find a good component to get the date-window.
             (e.g. with a calendar marking date-window or perhaps also 
              some days)
  - Todo: Load/Save information which graph (line/bar/...) is used.

  - ToDo: Save last Groupselection... (class+BasePaths?)
          --> Think of it! See GoldFind 2
          Use in InitPathTree (i.e. after configuration, too)
  - Todo: PopUp-Menu for group-tree, e.g. for "open groupS"
  - Idea: Automatism of GoldFind
     source, ng-list, [g[web]-]statistic, file, params

  - Idea: Mehrere MBoxe auswählen zum öffnen.
          Read in Mozilla-folder-format

  - ToDo: strg+f in memos (article+statistic)
          (in RX: additional marks? (neon-blue?)
  - ToDo: Focussed-color may be wrong (windows-standard need to be)
  - ToDo: Show "source" (caption) of result at search.
      a) Source (Pfad/Caption)
      b) NG
      c) ...
      -> Konfigurierbarkeit welche Spalten angezeigt werden sollen.

  - Idea: Complete redesign of search. Faster, easier, better. 
          (See Becky "ctrl+h")
  - Idea: First small change: or, and and not in three edit fields.
  - Idea: Statistics about search-result. (URKS, much to change :( )
  - Idea: In Incremental search "strg" & "shift" 
          as modifier (newsgroup-"hdt"-thing or so)
          Problem: Group may be doubled

  - Idea: Fileformat "The Bat" may be readable.

  - Long: Better/Real unicode-support (UTF-8: RFC 2279)
  - Long: An own dialog for OLE if present. You could delete/...
          Therefor you do not need OLE-HamNews.
         -> PopUp-Menu of group tree to go to
  - Long: IMAP - if I have ever MUCH MUCH time...

  - Chg: Search+Config-Dialog are now autosized. They may work 
         with big fonts now, but I did not test it...

         kills 3d-View.

         and "Message per Month(old)" were wrong. "Bad dates" was
         an random number and the last number was the true "Bad dates".
  - Fix: Alt now goes to menu again. You got to toolbar.
         Therefor I needed to switch off "caption" in toolbar...
         Don't ask me why it works like this only.

         more images than 36).

         is shown correctly... don't ask me why.

         datasources or only for the view.
